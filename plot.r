# Ross Ihaka explained the purpose of R was statistical analysis.
# To perform statistical analysis you must have data

# The datasets R base package contains data that may be used
# for statistical analysis

# Built in the datasets packages are various data frames upon
# which analysis may be performed

# get documentation on  the datasets package
?datasets

# to get documentation on a package, function, data frame, etc.
# You use the ?

# get listing of all data frames in the datasets package
library(help = "datasets")

# get documentation on the iris data frame
?iris

# show the first six rows of the iris data frame
head(iris)

# the iris data frame has 5 different variables:
# Species is a categorical variable(represents types of data that
# may be divided into groups)
# Sepal Length And Width, Petal Length and Width variables
# are quantitative (numerical) variables

# when doing data analysis, it's recommended that you look at the
# data visually first in the form of graphs and charts and then
# you look at the numbers available in the data or in other words
# you look at the statistics - median, mean, min, max, etc.

# get the documentation on the plot function
# plot may be used for basic graphics
# the plot function adapts to the number of variables you give it
# and the data types of the variables you give it
?plot

# create a plot matrix of scatter plots for all the data in the
# iris data frame
plot(iris)

# give plot function categorical variable in iris data frame
# reference the name of the data frame, then use the $, and
# then reference the variable
# plot knew to generate a bar chart
# x-axis is telling us the different types of species
# y-axis is telling us the number of data points in each species
plot(iris$Species)

# give plot function 1 quarantative variable in iris data frame
# plot function knew to generate a scatter plot
# x-axis is telling us that we have 50 data points in groupings
# y-axis is tellings us the petal lengths for the data points
plot(iris$Petal.Length)

# give plot function 1 categorical variable and 1 quantitative variable
# plot function knew to generate a box plot
# x-axis is telling us the species
# y-axis is telling us the petal width range for the species
plot(iris$Species, iris$Petal.Width)

# give plot function 2 quantitative variables and other options that
# give the plot more meaning
plot(iris$Petal.Length,# data points for the x-axis
     iris$Petal.Width, # data points for the y-axis
     col = "#cc0000",# hex code for red
     pch = 19, # solid circles
     main = "Iris: Petal Length vs. Petal Width", # main title
     xlab = "Petal Length",# x-axis label
     ylab = "Petal Width" # y-axis label
     )

# give the plot function a function
plot(cos,# trigonometric function
     0, # start point 
     2*pi # end point
)

# exponential function
plot(exp, 1, 5)

# density normal distribution function
plot(dnorm, -3, 3)

# give plot the dnorm function with options
plot(dnorm, -3, 3,
     col = "blue", # color blue
     lwd = 5, # wider line width
     main = "Standard Normal Distribution",
     xlab = "z-scores",
     ylab = "Density"
